.Sh NAME
.Nm entr
.Nd run arbitrary commands when files change
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar -r
.Ar utility
.Op Ar argument ...
.Ar {}
.Nm entr
.Ar +fifo
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm entr
has two modes of operation; the first use reads a list of files provided on STDIN
and executes the supplied
.Ar utility
if any of them change.
.Nm
waits for the child process to finish before responding to subsequent file
system events. A TTY is opened before entering the watch loop in order to
support the invocation of interactive utilities.
.Pp
.Ar -r
modifies the exec mode by launching the
.Ar utility at startup
and reloading it if one of the source files change. This features requires the
application to exit if it receives SIGTERM.
.Nm
always waits for the
.Ar utility to exit to ensure that resources such as sockets have been closed.
.Pp
The first occurrence of
.Ar {}
on the command line will be replaced with the absolute path of the first file
under watch. This is most useful for running or processing a single file.
.Pp
The second mode also reads a list of filenames provided on STDIN and is enabled
by specifying '+' and the name of a fifo. In this mode
.Nm
enables more sophisticated scripting by writing filenames to a named pipe when
they are modified.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If
.Ev PAGER
is undefined,
.Nm entr
will assign
.Pa /bin/cat
to prevent interactive utilities from waiting for
keyboard input if output does not fit on the screen.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm entr
utility does not normally return, but it will exit with a value of 0 if the
signal
.Dv SIGINT
or
.Dv SIGTERM
was received. An exit status of 1 indicates that no regular files were provided
as input.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Rebuild project when source files change
.Pp
.Dl $ find src | entr make
.Pp
Clear the screen and run tests
.Pp
.Dl $ ls *.py  | entr sh -c 'clear; ./test.py'
.Pp
Launch and auto-reload a node.js server
.Pp
.Dl $ ls *.js | entr -r node index.js
.Pp
Run an SQL query
.Pp
.Dl $ echo my.sql | entr psql -f {}
.Pp
Convert individual Markdown files to HTML if they're modified
.Pp
.Dl $ ls *.md | entr +notify &
.Dl $ while read F; do
.Dl >   markdown2html $F
.Dl > done < notify
.Sh CAVEATS
Only regular files are monitored, directories and special files are ignored.
